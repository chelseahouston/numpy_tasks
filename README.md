# NumPy Tasks
A program that:
- Prints a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 9.
- Prints a 3×3 NumPy array of all Trues.
- Extracts all odd numbers from array of 1-10.
- Subtracts 1 from each of the numbers in the above array (3).
- Converts a 1D array to a 2D array with 2 rows.
- Creates two arrays (a and b) - stack these two arrays vertically use the np.dot and np.sum to calculate totals.
- Create the following pattern without hardcoding. Use only NumPy  functions and the below input array.
array([1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3])
- In two arrays a ( 1,2,3,4,5) and b ( 4,5,6,7,8,9) – remove all repeating  items present in array b
- Get all integers between 5 and 10 from arrays a and b (Task 8) and sum them together.
